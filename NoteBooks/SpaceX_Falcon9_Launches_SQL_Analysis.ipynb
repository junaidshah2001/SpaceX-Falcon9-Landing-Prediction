        "\n",
        "This notebook marks the transition from data preparation to strategic business intelligence. After successfully acquiring and cleaning the data, this phase focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed through structured SQL queries on a temporary SQLite database.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Business Mandate: From Data to Decision\n",
        "For the fictional competitor, Space Y, understanding the historical performance levers of the Falcon 9 is paramount for risk management and competitive pricing. Raw data alone is insufficient; we require calculated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Using SQL allows us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calculate Aggregates:** Determine precise success rates (the average of the binary Class column) across categorical variables like LaunchSite and Orbit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Uncover Trends:** Track the evolution of reusability success over time to identify technological maturation points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Validate Hypotheses:** Test initial assumptions, such as the correlation between PayloadMass and landing success probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structured intelligence, derived efficiently through SQL, provides the vital quantitative foundation for analyzing risk and setting competitive launch prices before the final machine learning model is trained.\n",

        "**ðŸ’¾ Phase 1:** Database Setup and Data Ingestion\n",
        "The initial code blocks establish the in-memory SQLite database connection and ingest the prepared spacex_clean_data.csv file, converting our clean DataFrame into a searchable relational table.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ðŸ”Ž Phase 2**: Key Business Intelligence Queries\n",
        "This phase executes the critical SQL statements needed to extract specific insights. For each query, the Python code will execute the SQL and display the resulting DataFrame for interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query A:** Overall Launch Success Rate\n",
        "Goal: Determine the project's baseline by calculating the overall percentage of successful reusability attempts (Class = 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query B:** Success Rate Per Launch Site\n",
        "Goal: Identify which primary launch site provides the best performance history for successful first-stage recovery. This highlights geographical and logistical factors influencing success.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query C:** Success Rate Per Orbit Type\n",
        "Goal: Analyze how different orbital destinations (LEO, GTO, SSO, etc.) correlate with reusability success, providing insight into mission difficulty and fuel margins.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query D:** Launch Trends Over Time (Yearly Analysis)\n",
        "Goal: Track the progress of the Falcon 9 program by calculating the average success rate and average PayloadMass for each year. This reveals the program's learning curve and maturation timeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Query E:** Payload Mass vs. Outcome\n",
        "Goal: Quantify the impact of mission payload size by finding the average PayloadMass for missions that succeeded (Class = 1) versus those that failed (Class = 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "**âœ… Phase 3:** Conclusion and Analytical Summary\n",
        "After executing the queries above, this final section will interpret the resulting data and synthesize the key findings. The analytical summary confirms which features (e.g., Launch Site, Orbit, Time) are statistically significant, providing clear justification for their use in the subsequent machine learning models."
